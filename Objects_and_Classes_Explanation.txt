OBJECTS AND CLASSES – SIMPLE EXPLANATION (Based on Robert Lafore, Object-Oriented Programming in C++, 4th Edition)

1. OBJECT
An object is a real-world entity represented in a program.
It combines:
- Data (attributes)
- Functions (behavior)

Example (Real world):
Car
- Data: color, speed, fuel
- Behavior: start(), stop(), accelerate()

In C++:
An object is a variable of a class.
Objects interact with each other by calling member functions.

Key points about Objects:
- Objects occupy memory
- Objects hide their data (data encapsulation)
- Data can only be accessed using member functions

2. CLASS
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
It defines:
- What data an object will have
- What functions the object can perform

Example:
Class = Car
Objects = car1, car2, car3

Syntax example:
class Car {
  private:
    int speed;
  public:
    void setSpeed(int s);
    int getSpeed();
};

Key points about Classes:
- Class does NOT occupy memory
- Objects of the class occupy memory
- A class groups data and functions together

3. OBJECTS VS CLASSES
Class:
- Blueprint
- Logical entity
- No memory allocation

Object:
- Instance of a class
- Physical entity
- Memory allocated

4. WHY OBJECTS AND CLASSES ARE IMPORTANT
- Better real-world modeling
- Data security using data hiding
- Easy maintenance and debugging
- Code reusability
- Reduced complexity

5. ENCAPSULATION
Encapsulation means wrapping data and functions into a single unit (class).
Direct access to data is not allowed.
Only member functions can modify data.

6. SIMPLE EXAMPLE
class Counter {
  private:
    int count;
  public:
    Counter() { count = 0; }
    void increment() { count++; }
    int getCount() { return count; }
};

Here:
- Counter is a class
- count is data
- increment() and getCount() are member functions
- Each object of Counter has its own count value

7. REAL-WORLD ANALOGY
Class → Blueprint of a house
Object → Actual house built using the blueprint
